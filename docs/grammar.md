# analog's fluent grammar

The following grammar describes the entirety of analog's fluent analysis API. It
directly translates into code. For example, the first alternative of `selection`
combined with the first alternative of `protocol` and the last alternative of
`selection` translates into `.only.bots()`, an expression to filter out requests
not made by bots. In translation, `<dot>` becomes a literal dot `.` and `ùúÄ`
means "nothing." Parentheses are not used for grouping in the grammar; they
specify method arguments and hence remain during translation.
